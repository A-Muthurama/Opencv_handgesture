# OpenCV Hand Gesture and Facial Recognition

This project demonstrates real-time hand gesture and facial recognition using OpenCV and MediaPipe. The program captures live video from a webcam, detects hands and faces in the video stream, and highlights landmarks on the hands and face.

## Features
- Detects and tracks hand gestures using MediaPipe's Hand module.
- Detects faces and facial landmarks using MediaPipe's Face Detection module.
- Real-time processing of video feed captured from a webcam.
- Displays the output video with the landmarks drawn on the detected hands and faces.

## Technologies Used
- **OpenCV**: For capturing video feed and handling image processing.
- **MediaPipe**: For detecting hands and faces and drawing landmarks.
- **Matplotlib** (optional): For displaying the video frames when GUI windowing is not supported.
